Description: Room equalization REST API with high-performance Rust optimizer
 A comprehensive REST API for audio measurements including microphone
 detection, SPL measurement, signal generation, and advanced room EQ
 optimization. Features scipy-based optimization algorithms with real-time
 progress reporting, multiple target curves, and biquad filter generation.
 .
 Includes a high-performance Rust-based optimizer (roomeq-optimizer) that
 provides 10-20x faster processing compared to the Python implementation
 while maintaining full algorithm compatibility.
