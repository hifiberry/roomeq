Description: Room equalization REST API with high-performance Rust optimizer
 A comprehensive REST API for audio measurements including microphone
 detection, SPL measurement, signal generation, and advanced room EQ
 optimization. Features a high-performance Rust-based optimizer with real-time
 progress reporting, frequency response calculation, multiple target curves,
 and biquad filter generation.
 .
 The Rust optimizer (roomeq-optimizer) provides streaming output of
 optimization progress and frequency response data after each filter step.
 .
 Also includes acoustic measurement tools:
 - fft-analyse: FFT analysis tool for frequency response measurement
 - record-sweep: Script for recording frequency sweeps
 - room-measure: Automated multi-measurement acoustic analysis
