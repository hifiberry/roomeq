.TH ROOM-MEASURE 1 "August 2025" "roomeq" "HiFiBerry Tools"
.SH NAME
room-measure \- Perform multiple acoustic measurements and analysis
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B room-measure
\fIrecord-device\fR \fIchannel\fR \fInumber-of-measurements\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B room-measure
is a comprehensive acoustic measurement script that performs multiple sweep recordings and averages the results for improved accuracy. It automates the complete measurement process from signal generation to FFT analysis.

The script performs the specified number of measurements, processes them with FFT analysis, and outputs the averaged frequency response data.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIrecord-device\fR
ALSA recording device (e.g., hw:0,0)
.TP
\fIchannel\fR
Channel configuration: "left" or "right"
.TP
\fInumber-of-measurements\fR
Number of measurements to average (recommended: 3-8)
.SH EXAMPLES
Perform 8 measurements using hw:0,0 with left channel:
.nf
room-measure hw:0,0 left 8
.fi

This will:
.br
1. Record 8 separate sweep measurements
.br
2. Average the results using fft-analyse
.br
3. Output the final frequency response
.SH FILES
Results are copied to /tmp/:
.TP
\fBfftdB_vbw.csv\fR
Final averaged frequency response analysis
.TP
\fBrecording.wav\fR
First measurement for reference
.TP
\fBraw.wav\fR
Raw recording data
.TP
\fBsignal.wav\fR
Reference sweep signal
.SH WORKFLOW
1. Creates temporary working directory
.br
2. Runs record-sweep for each measurement
.br
3. Processes all recordings with fft-analyse
.br
4. Copies results to /tmp/ 
.br
5. Cleans up temporary files
.SH REQUIREMENTS
- fft-analyse (for processing)
.br
- record-sweep (for recordings)
.br
- Standard audio tools (sox, arecord, play)
