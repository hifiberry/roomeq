.SH NAME
fft-analyse \- HiFiBerry MultiFFT Tool for acoustic frequency analysis
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fft-analyse
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fB\-r\fR \fIreference-file\fR \fIfile1\fR \fIfile2\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fft-analyse
is a tool for performing FFT analysis on WAV audio files to analyze frequency response characteristics. It compares recorded audio files against a reference file to compute the frequency response difference.

The tool reads 32-bit mono WAV files, performs Fast Fourier Transform analysis, and outputs the results to CSV format for further analysis. It's designed for acoustic measurement and room correction applications.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-r\fR \fIreference-file\fR
Specify the reference WAV file to compare against (required)
.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fInumber\fR
Number of reduced FFT sample points (default: 64)
.TP
\fB\-v\fR \fIlevel\fR
Set verbosity level for detailed output
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Show help message and exit
.SH FILES
The tool outputs analysis results to:
.TP
\fBfftdB_vbw.csv\fR
Frequency response data in CSV format with frequency, magnitude (dB), and phase information
.SH EXAMPLES
Analyze multiple recordings against a reference sweep:
.nf
fft-analyse -v 1 -r signal.wav recording1.wav recording2.wav recording3.wav
.fi

This will compare the recordings against the reference and output the averaged frequency response to fftdB_vbw.csv.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
Input files must be:
.br
- 32-bit mono WAV files
.br
- Same sample rate as reference file
